# Mastering Array Problems - From Basics to Advanced

Arrays are a fundamental data structure in programming, providing a way to store and manipulate collections of data. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced programmer, solving problems involving arrays is crucial for developing strong coding skills. In this blog post, we'll explore a series of array problems, sorted by increasing difficulty, and provide solutions to each. Let's dive in!

## Level 1: Essential Operations

## 1. Count Elements in an Array: How Many Elements Are There?

Knowing the size of your array is crucial. Learn two methods to efficiently determine the number of elements in an array.

**Problem:** Determine the number of elements stored in an array.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    int arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4};
    int product = 1;
    for (int i = 0; i < size(arr); i++)
    {
        product *= arr[i];
    }
    cout << "Product: " << product << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

This code snippet tackles a mathematical operation on arrays: calculating the product of all its elements. It accomplishes this by:

**Declaring and initializing an array:** The code creates an array named arr and assigns values to it.
**Setting up a variable for the product:** It initializes a variable named product to store the accumulated result.
**Looping through the array:** The code iterates through each element in the array.
**Multiplying elements into the product:** Within the loop, it multiplies the current element's value with the running product.
**Printing the result:** Finally, the code displays the calculated product of all elements in the array.

### 2. Find the Sum of All Elements in an Array: Calculate the Total

Need to calculate the combined value of all elements in an array? This problem walks you through finding the sum of an array.

**Problem:** Given an array arr of integers, calculate the total sum of its elements. 

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    int arr[5] = {4, 5, 6, 7, 8};
    int sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < size(arr); i++)
    {
        sum += arr[i];
    }
    cout << "The sum of the elements in the array is : " << sum << endl;
}
```

This code snippet tackles a fundamental task in arrays: calculating the total sum of all its elements. It accomplishes this by:

**Declaring and initializing an array:** The code creates an array named arr and assigns values to it.
**Setting up a variable for the sum:** It initializes a variable named sum to keep track of the total.
**Looping through the array:** The code iterates through each element in the array.
**Adding elements to the sum:** Within the loop, it adds the current element's value to the sum variable.
**Printing the result:** Finally, the code displays the calculated sum of all elements in the array.\
**Problem:** Determine the number of elements stored in an array.

### 3. Find the Product of All Elements in an Array: Multiply Them All

This problem delves into calculating the product (multiplication) of all elements within an array.

**Problem:** Given an array arr of integers, calculate the product of all its elements.  

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    int arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4};
    int product = 1;
    for (int i = 0; i < size(arr); i++)
    {
        product *= arr[i];
    }
    cout << "Product: " << product << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### 4. Find the Greatest and Smallest Elements in an Array: Identify the Extremes

Unearth the largest and smallest values within an array using this step-by-step guide.

**Problem:** Identify the largest and smallest values within an array.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    int arr[5] = {4, 5, 6, 7, 8};
    int sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < size(arr); i++)
    {
        sum += arr[i];
    }
    cout << "The sum of the elements in the array is : " << sum << endl;
}
```

Want to find and display only elements that exceed a specific value (X)? This problem equips you with the solution.

**Problem:** Print elements greater than X in an array.  

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    int arr[5] = {4, 5, 6, 7, 8};
    int sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < size(arr); i++)
    {
        sum += arr[i];
    }
    cout << "The sum of the elements in the array is : " << sum << endl;
}
```

### 2. Find the Difference Between Sum of Elements at Even and Odd Indices: Even vs. Odd

This problem presents a unique challenge: calculating the difference between the sum of elements at even and odd indices within the array. 

**Problem:** Find the difference between the sum of elements at even indices and the sum at odd indices. 

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    int arr[5] = {4, 5, 6, 7, 8};
    int sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < size(arr); i++)
    {
        sum += arr[i];
    }
    cout << "The sum of the elements in the array is : " << sum << endl;
}
```

### 3. Reverse the Given Array: Flip the Order

Master the art of reversing an array, effectively rearranging elements from the end to the beginning.

**Problem:** Reverse the given array.  

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    int arr[5] = {4, 5, 6, 7, 8};
    int sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < size(arr); i++)
    {
        sum += arr[i];
    }
    cout << "The sum of the elements in the array is : " << sum << endl;
}
```

### 4. Modify Array Based on Index Conditions: Conditional Transformations

This problem takes array manipulation a step further, instructing you to modify elements based on their even or odd indices.

**Problem:** Change the value of odd indexed elements to its second multiple and increment all even indexed values by 10 

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    int arr[5] = {4, 5, 6, 7, 8};
    int sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < size(arr); i++)
    {
        sum += arr[i];
    }
    cout << "The sum of the elements in the array is : " << sum << endl;
}
```

### 5. Identify Students with Marks Below a Threshold: Find Failing Students

Given an array of student marks, this problem helps you identify and print the roll numbers (indices) of students who scored below a specific threshold.

**Problem:** Given an array of student marks, print the roll number (index) if the mark is less than 35. 

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    int arr[5] = {4, 5, 6, 7, 8};
    int sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < size(arr); i++)
    {
        sum += arr[i];
    }
    cout << "The sum of the elements in the array is : " << sum << endl;
}
```

### 6. Find the Number of Pairs with a Given Sum: Two Elements, One Target

This intermediate challenge introduces the concept of finding pairs of elements within an array whose sum equals a specific value.

**Problem:** Count the pairs of elements in an array whose sum equals a specific value.

    int sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < size(arr); i++)
    {
        sum += arr[i];
    }
    cout << "The sum of the elements in the array is : " << sum << endl;
}
```

### 3. Find the Number of Triplets with a Given Sum: Three Elements, One Target

This problem builds upon the concept of finding pairs. Here, you'll learn how to count triplets of elements that add up to a specific value within the array.

**Problem:** Count the triplets of elements in an array that add up to a given value.  

```cpp
