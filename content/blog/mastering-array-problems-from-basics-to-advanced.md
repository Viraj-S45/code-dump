Knowing the size of your array is crucial. Learn two methods to efficiently determine the number of elements in an array.

**Problem:** Determine the number of elements stored in an array.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    int arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4};
    cout << "Total Elements: " << size(arr) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

**Output:**

```bash
Total Elements: 4
```

### 2. Find the Sum of All Elements in an Array: Calculate the Total

Need to calculate the combined value of all elements in an array? This problem walks you through finding the sum of an array.

**Problem:** Given an array arr of integers, calculate the total sum of its elements. 

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    int arr[5] = {4, 5, 6, 7, 8};
    int sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < size(arr); i++)
    {
        sum += arr[i];
    }
    cout << "The sum of the elements in the array is : " << sum << endl;
}
```

**Output:**

```bash
The sum of the elements in the array is : 30
```

### 3. Find the Product of All Elements in an Array: Multiply Them All

This problem delves into calculating the product (multiplication) of all elements within an array.

**Problem:** Given an array arr of integers, calculate the product of all its elements.  

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    int arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4};
    int product = 1;
    for (int i = 0; i < size(arr); i++)
    {
        product *= arr[i];
    }
    cout << "Product: " << product << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

**Output:**

```bash
Product: 24
```

### 4. Find the Greatest and Smallest Elements in an Array: Identify the Extremes

Unearth the largest and smallest values within an array using this step-by-step guide.

**Problem:** Identify the largest and smallest values within an array.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    int arr[5] = {4, 5, 6, 7, 8};
    int max, min;
    max = arr[0];
    min = arr[0];
    for (int i = 0; i < size(arr); i++)
    {
        if (arr[i] > max)
        {
            max = arr[i];
        }
        else if (arr[i] < min)
        {
            min = arr[i];
        }
    }
    cout << "Max value: " << max << endl
         << "Min value: " << min << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

**Ouput:**

```bash
Max value: 8
Min value: 4
```

    sumEven = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < size(arr); i++)
    {
        if (i % 2 == 0)
        {
            sumEven += arr[i];
        }
        else
            sumOdd += arr[i];
    }
    cout << "The difference between sum of elements at odd and even indices is " << sumEven - sumOdd << endl;
    return 0;
}

    int iteration = 0;
    for (int i = size(a) - 1; i >= 0; i--)
    {
        b[iteration] = a[i];
        iteration++;
    }
    for (int j = 0; j < size(b); j++)
    {
        cout << b[j] << " ";
    }
    return 0;
}
```

**Output:**

```bash
