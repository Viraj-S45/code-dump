# Code Dumps

Welcome to my personal blog, built using Astro with the Blogster Bubblegum theme. This site is hosted on Netlify and the domain is purchased from GoDaddy. Here, I share all the codes and knowledge I gain during my journey of learning C++ and Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA).




## Features

- **Astro Framework**: Built with [Astro](https://docs.astro.build/en/getting-started/) for a fast and optimized performance.
- **[Blogster Bubblegum Theme](https://astro.build/themes/details/blogster-bubblegum/)**: Aesthetic and responsive theme.
- **Decap CMS**: Easy blog management with [Decap CMS](https://decapcms.org/docs/basic-steps/).
- **Learning Blog**: Focus on C++ and DSA content.


## Getting Started

#### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your local machine:

- [Node.js](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)
- [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)
### Installation

1. Clone the repository:


```bash
  git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
  cd your-repo-name

```
2. Install dependencies:


```bash
  npm install

```
## Running the Site Locally

To run the website locally, use the following command:

```bash
  npm run dev

```
This will start the development server and you can view the website by navigating to http://localhost:3000 in your web browser.

## Deployment

The website is hosted on [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com). To deploy the site:

    1.  Push your code to a GitHub repository.

    2.  Connect your repository to Netlify.

    3.  Netlify will automatically build and deploy your site.

For detailed steps on deploying to Netlify, refer to the [Netlify Documentation](https://docs.netlify.com/get-started/).

## Netlify CMS

This project uses [Decap CMS](https://decapcms.org/docs/basic-steps/) for managing blog posts. To access the CMS, navigate to ``` /admin ``` on your deployed site. For example:

```bash
  https://your-domain.com/admin

```

You can then log in and manage your blog posts easily through the CMS interface.
